Poisson and Weiner Processes in Python

This is an implementation of two processes in two different scripts.

1) PDF of Epoch times of Poisson process by approximating large number of Bernoulli trials.Each Bernoulli trial's outcome is generated by thresholding a uniform random number generator's output at 1-p, where p is the required mean of the Bernoulli trial. 

2) PDF,CDF and correlations of  of Wiener's Process from an underlying Gaussian Process.

Part of an assignment for EE2110 at Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad.


Description:

-> poission.py contains the implementation of a Poission Arrival Time Generator using Bernoulli Approximation

-> densityfunctions.py contains the implementation of functions that calculate PDF and CDF

-> Brownian.py contains the implementation of n-dim Wiener Process instances and related correlated process

-> ecgprocess.m implements processing of ECG data as asked for

-> wienerFilter.m implements a Wiener filter
